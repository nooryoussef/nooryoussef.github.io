Recently, work on the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis suggested that a nucleotide motif in the control region of this species, known as the sperm transmission element (STE), helps protect male-transmitted mitochondria from destruction during spermatogenesis. Subsequent studies found similar, yet divergent, STE motifs in other marine mussels. Here, we extend the in silico search for mtDNA signatures resembling known STEs. This search is carried out for the large unassigned regions of 157 complete mitochondrial genomes from within the Mytiloida, Veneroida, Unionoida, and Ostreoida bivalve orders. Based on a sliding window approach, we present evidence that there are additional putative STE signatures in the large unassigned regions of several marine clams and freshwater mussels with DUI. We discuss the implications of this finding for interpreting the origin of doubly uniparental inheritance in ancestral bivalve mollusks, as well as potential future in vitro and in silico studies that could further refine our understanding of the early evolution of this unusual system of mtDNA inheritance.","tags":[],"title":"Expanding the search for sperm transmission elements in the mitochondrial genomes of bivalve mollusks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Noor Youssef","Edward Susko","Andrew Roger","Joseph Bielawski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1624838400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624838400,"objectID":"72c120f7a94ae98cd837061418112292","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/youssef_etal_2021a/","publishdate":"2021-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/youssef_etal_2021a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Shifts in amino acid preferences as proteins evolve: A synthesis of experimental and theoretical work","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Noor Youssef","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

If so, what consequences might they have on inference from traditional codon substitution models which assume site- independence for the sake of computational tractability? To investigate the effects of epistasis on substitution rates, we employed a mechanistic mutation-selection model in conjunction with a fitness framework derived from protein stability. We refer to this as the stability-informed site-dependent (S-SD) model and developed a new stability-informed site-independent (S-SI) model that captures the average effect of stability constraints on individual sites of a protein. Comparison of S-SI and S-SD offers a novel and direct method for investigating the consequences of stability-induced epistasis on protein evolution. We developed S-SI and S-SD models for three natural proteins and showed that they generate sequences consistent with real alignments. Our analyses revealed that epistasis tends to increase substitution rates compared with the rates under site-independent evolution. We then assessed the epistatic sensitivity of individual site and discovered a counterintuitive effect: Highly connected sites were less influenced by epistasis relative to exposed sites. Lastly, we show that, despite the unrealistic assumptions, traditional models perform comparably well in the presence and absence of epistasis and provide reasonable summaries of average selection intensities. We conclude that epistatic models are critical to understanding protein evolutionary dynamics, but epistasis might not be required for reasonable inference of selection pressure when averaging over time and sites.","tags":[],"title":"Consequences of Stability-Induced Epistasis for Substitution Rates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Jones","Noor Youssef","Edward Susko","Joseph Bielawski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"434c3595409d73e05bdd5d4744b75764","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/jones_etal_2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jones_etal_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"A central objective in biology is to link adaptive evolution in a gene to structural and/or functional phenotypic novelties. Yet most analytic methods make inferences mainly from either phenotypic data or genetic data alone. A small number of models have been developed to infer correlations between the rate of molecular evolution and changes in a discrete or continuous life history trait. But such correlations are not necessarily evidence of adaptation. Here, we present a novel approach called the phenotype‚Äìgenotype branch-site model (PG-BSM) designed to detect evidence of adaptive codon evolution associated with discrete-state phenotype evolution. An episode of adaptation is inferred under standard codon substitution models when there is evidence of positive selection in the form of an elevation in the nonsynonymous- to-synonymous rate ratio œâ to a value œâ\u003e1. As it is becoming increasingly clear that œâ\u003e1 can occur without adaptation, the PG-BSM was formulated to infer an instance of adaptive evolution without appealing to evidence of positive selection. The null model makes use of a covarion-like component to account for general heterotachy (i.e., random changes in the evolutionary rate at a site over time). The alternative model employs samples of the phenotypic evolutionary history to test for phenomenological patterns of heterotachy consistent with specific mechanisms of molecular adaptation. These include 1) a persistent increase/decrease in œâ at a site following a change in phenotype (the pattern) consistent with an increase/decrease in the functional importance of the site (the mechanism); and 2) a transient increase in œâ at a site along a branch over which the phenotype changed (the pattern) consistent with a change in the site‚Äôs optimal amino acid (the mechanism). Rejection of the null is followed by post hoc analyses to identify sites with strongest evidence for adaptation in association with changes in the phenotype as well as the most likely evolutionary history of the phenotype. Simulation studies based on a novel method for generating mechanistically realistic signatures of molecular adaptation show that the PG-BSM has good statistical properties. Analyses of real alignments show that site patterns identified post hoc are consistent with the specific mechanisms of adaptation included in the alternate model. Further simulation studies show that the covarion-like component of the PG-BSM plays a crucial role in mitigating recently discovered statistical pathologies associated with confounding by accounting for heterotachy-by-any-cause.","tags":[],"title":"A Phenotype-Genotype Codon Model for Detecting Adaptive Evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Donald T Stewart","Sophie Breton","Emily E Chase","Brent M Robicheau","Stefano Bettinazzi","Eric Pante","Noor Youssef","Manuel A Garrido-Ramos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"4d3395841f51efa9a11c248e325a33a1","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/stewart_etal_2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stewart_etal_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is typically passed on to progeny only by the female parent. The phenomenon of doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) of mtDNA in many bivalve species is a fascinating exception to the paradigm of strict maternal inheritance of mtDNA. In this review, we survey the current state of knowledge of DUI and discuss several active areas of research in this field. Topics/questions covered include: the number of times DUI evolved (once or multiple origins), the link between DUI and sex determination, the role(s) of mtDNA-encoded non-oxidative phosphorylation genes (i.e. ORFan/orf genes) in freshwater mussels, the function of conserved sequence motifs and sperm transmission elements in mtDNA of marine mussels, the challenges of annotating mtDNA genomes of DUI species, the presence of unorthodox features in venerid mtDNA, whether or not orf DNA sequences are useful in species-level identification of freshwater mussel, and finally, whether or not there are obvious benefits of DUI. For each topic, we also highlight important avenues for future research within this fascinating field of mitochondrial evolutionary biology.","tags":[],"title":"An unusual evolutionary strategy: the origins, genetic repertoire, and implications of doubly uniparental inheritance of mitochondrial DNA in bivalves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Noor Youssef","Aidan Budd","Joseph Bielawski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"5b387fa6e0ac0bd6866e95d4db13f1d1","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/youssef_etal_2019/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/youssef_etal_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Organisms display astonishing levels of cell and molecular diversity, including genome size, shape, and architecture. In this chapter, we review how the genome can be viewed as both a structural and an informational unit of biological diversity and explicitly define our intended meaning of genetic information. A brief overview of the characteristic features of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic cell types and viruses sets the stage for a review of the differences in organization, size, and packaging strategies of their genomes. We include a detailed review of genetic elements found outside the primary chromosomal structures, as these provide insights into how genomes are sometimes viewed as incomplete informational entities. Lastly, we reassess the definition of the genome in light of recent advancements in our understanding of the diversity of genomic structures and the mechanisms by which genetic information is expressed within the cell. Collectively, these topics comprise a good introduction to genome biology for the newcomer to the field and provide a valuable reference for those developing new statistical or computation methods in genomics. This review also prepares the reader for anticipated transformations in thinking as the field of genome biology progresses.","tags":[],"title":"Introduction to Genome Biology and Diversity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

A parameter might therefore absorb a substantial quantity of the total variance in an alignment (or more formally, bring about a substantial reduction in the deviance of the fitted model) even if the process it represents played no role in the generation of the data. When this occurs, we say that the parameter estimate carries phenomenological load (PL). Large PL in a parameter estimate is a concern because it not only invalidates its mechanistic interpretation (if it has one) but also increases the likelihood that it will be found to be statistically significant. The problem of PL was not identified in the past because most off-the-shelf substitution models make simplifying assumptions that preclude the generation of realistic levels of variation. In this study, we use the more realistic mutation-selection framework as the basis of a generating model formulated to produce data that mimic an alignment of mammalian mitochondrial DNA. We show that a parameter estimate can carry PL when 1) the substitution model is underspecified and 2) the parameter represents a process that is confounded with other processes represented in the data-generating model. We then provide a method that can be used to identify signal for the process that a given parameter represents despite the existence of PL.","tags":[],"title":"Phenomenological Load on Model Parameters Can Lead to False Biological Conclusions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Jones","Noor Youssef","Edward Susko","Joseph Bielawski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510358400,"objectID":"8e4543cdfadd63c637d940338b614da7","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/jones_etal_2017/","publishdate":"2017-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jones_etal_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"A version of the mechanistic mutation‚Äìselection (MutSel) model that accounts for temporal dynamics at a site is presented. This is used to show that the rate ratio dN/dS at a site can be transiently \u003e1 even when fitness coefficients are fixed or the fitness landscape is static. This occurs whenever a site drifts away from its fitness peak and is then forced back by selection, a process reminiscent of shifting balance. Shifting balance is strongest when the substitution process is not dominated by selection or drift, but admits interplay between the two. Under this condition, site-specific changes in dN/dS were inferred in 78‚Äì100% of trials, and positive selection (i.e., dN/dS \u003e 1) in 10‚Äì40% of trials, when sequence alignments generated under MutSel were fitted to two popular phenomenological branch-site models. These results demonstrate that positive selection can occur without a change in fitness regime, and that this is detectable by branch- site models. In addition, MutSel is used to show that a site can be occupied by a sub-optimal amino acid for long periods on a fixed landscape when selection is stringent. This has implications for the interpretation of constant-but-different site patterns typically attributed to changes in fitness. Furthermore, a version of MutSel with episodic changes in fitness coefficients is used to illustrate systematic differences between parameters used to generate data under MutSel and their counterparts estimated by a simple codon model. Motivated by a discrepancy in the literature, interpretation of dN/dS in the context of MutSel is also discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Shifting Balance on a Static Mutation‚ÄìSelection Landscape: A Novel Scenario of Positive Selection","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
